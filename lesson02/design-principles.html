                <p>Nike is a great example of using the rule of thirds to ensure that they are grabbing the viewers attention to their main focal point. They have AJ Brown holding the football decked out in Nike gear as the main focal point. 
                They have a nice balance of white space and their main image. Their website is aesthetically pleasing.</p>
